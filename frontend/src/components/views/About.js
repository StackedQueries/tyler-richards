                        <p>I'm an Atlanta based web developer that makes ~almost~ cool things. Since I got into programming, back in ~2015ish, I have had the pleasure
                            of getting to work with loads of technologies including Python, Java, and JS, and study topics ranging from AI and Machine learning all the way to
                            creating automatic deploying tools. As of now, I'm working on fullstack applications like this very site and writing the occasional article! Right now, I'm really enjoying using
                            React, Express, and tools like Docker and MongoDB to create things.
